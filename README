Embed.ly Challenge
===

I did the three puzzles for fun and am putting them up here for posterity. The
second file (pstddev.rb) requires nokogiri which may be a pain to install.

All solutions tested on ruby 1.9.3-p0 on Ubuntu.


Notes
===

fac.rb - Just a basic memoized factorial algorithm.

pstddev.rb - Parse with Nokogiri, recursive counting solution.

zipf.rb - The only tricky part of this puzzle was a couple of off-by-one mistakes.
